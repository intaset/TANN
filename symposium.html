    <h3>Symposium</h3>
  	<p class="body">The International Conference of Theoretical and Applied Nanoscience and Nanotechnology (TANN'17) invites you to propose a symposium.</p>

   <p class="body">The proposed symposium, if accepted, will be co-located with and under the umbrella of the conference.</p>

   <p class="body">Proposals by prospective chairs should be submitted to <a href="mailto:info@tannconference.com" class="body-link">info@tannconference.com</a> and will be evaluated by the Organizing and Scientific Committees. Upon approval, the Organizing Committee will disseminate the news through the conference website and call for papers. To obtain a high attendance, we kindly ask that the prospective chairs also publicize the event and personally contact researchers who they think will be interested to contribute. The minimum number of registered presenters for the event to take place is 7. Should attendance reach this minimum requirement, registration fees for the Chair will be waived.</p>

   <p class="body">If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us at <a href="mailto:info@tannconference.com" class="body-link">info@tannconference.com</a>.</p>
   <!-- <p class="body">The Organizing Committee has selected the following fields for specialized and focused symposiums under the umbrella of TANN'17:</p>

       <ul class="topics">
        <li><a href="../biomr" class="body-link">Biomechatronics and Biorobotics</a></li>

</ul>

   <p class="body">If you are interested for your article to be part of the above-mentioned symposiums, please inform us when submitting your article. Symposium articles will go through a regular peer-review process. Accepted symposium articles will be published along with the rest of the accepted manuscripts in the main proceedings. A minimum of 7 articles need to be accepted for each Symposium to go ahead as planned. Should this requirement not be reached, accepted papers will be moved to the main track of the conference in related sessions.</p>

   <p class="body">If you would like to propose a symposium other than the ones mentioned above, please submit your proposal to <a href="mailto:info@tannconference.com" class="body-link">info@tannconference.com</a>.

      <p class="body"><b>Topic of Workshop:<i><br>Development of Hetero-nanostructures for Advanced Biomedical Applications</i></b> </p>

      <p class="body">Tailor-made nanosystem refers the integration of different components/materials at nanoscale which can show multi-functional and unique properties. Rational design and fabrication of such hetero-nanostructures are vital to break the boundaries of traditional technologies. One of Dr. Jin Zhang’s research interests lies in producing magnetic and optical hetero-nanostructures which show distinguish properties, and have been applied in various devices, e.g. data storage, sensors, and targeted drug delivery, etc. It is quite challenge to control the interface of magnetic and non-magnetic materials to precisely gain the desired properties. Here, Dr. Zhang will show different hetero-nanostructures with magnetic and optical properties (from zero-dimensional hetero-nanostructures to three dimensional hetero-nanostructures). In addition, incorporating proteins with nanomaterials can enhance protein’s stabilities, and may lead to new applications. This workshop will also focuse on the different interactions between proteins and designed hetero-nanostructures. The applications of the protein-conjugated hetero-nanostructures in non-invasive biosensor and targeted drug delivery will be discussed.</p>
