<p class="body">Toronto is the largest city in the province of Ontario, the largest city in Canada and the fifth largest in North America. It is situated on the northwestern shore of Lake Ontario, in Southern Ontario. The city name is derived from the Mohawk phrase of "tkaronto" which means "where there are trees standing in the water". This city, which hosts the theatre and performing arts scene, exquisite cuisine and restaurants, breathtaking skylines and architectures and elegant shopping districts, is constantly named "the world's most livable city" according to the Economist Intelligence Unit and the Mercer Quality of Living Survey. Toronto is Canada's commercial capital, as it is home to the Toronto Stock Exchange and Canada's five largest banks. </p>
