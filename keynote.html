  <p class="body">Dr. Simone Pisana received his B.A.Sc. in Engineering Science and M.A.Sc. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Toronto in 2002 and 2004, respectively. He then moved to the University of Cambridge, where he received his Ph.D. degree in Engineering in 2008. His graduate studies focused on the electronic properties of carbon nanotubes, semiconducting nanowires, and graphene. In 2008, he joined Hitachi Global Storage Technologies as a Postdoctoral Researcher and continued on to become Research Staff Member in 2010 and Senior Research Manager in 2014. While in the industry, he worked on nanoscale magnetic field sensing devices and energy-assisted magnetic recording technologies.</p>
  
  <p class="body">Dr. Pisana joined the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in the Lassonde School of Engineering at York University in 2014 as Associate Professor. His research explores transport phenomena in nanoscale devices & materials for energy efficient nanoelectronic device engineering. He is Senior Member of the IEEE, and has authored 39 refereed journal articles with over 5,000 citations. He received the Young Scientist Award at the European Materials Research Society 2007 Spring Meeting and participated as Outstanding Young Scientist at the 57th Meeting of Nobel Laureates in Lindau, Germany.
