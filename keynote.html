  <p class="body">Dr. Yuning Li is Professor in the Department of Chemical Engineering with affiliation to the Waterloo Institute for Nanotechnology (WIN) at University of Waterloo. He received his bachelor and master degrees in polymer materials from Dalian University of Technology in China in 1985 and 1988, respectively, and his Ph.D. in materials science from Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (JAIST) in 1999. Prior to joining the University of Waterloo, he worked in the research labs at Simon Fraser University, the National Research Council Canada (NRC), Xerox Research Centre Canada (XRCC), and the Institute of Materials Research and Engineering (IMRE), the Agency for Science, Technology and Research  (A*STAR) (Singapore).  Since 1999, Dr. Li has been working on printed electronics including organic light emitting diodes, organic thin film transistors, and organic photovoltaics with an emphasis of his effort on the development of polymer semiconductors materials. He is a co-recipient of the 2nd Runner Up in Materials Category for "The Best and the Brightest New Technology for 2004" by <i>Wall Street Journal</i> and a co-recipient of the 3rd Annual NASA Nano 50â„¢ Awards (2007) for Printed Organic Electronics. He has published ~140 refereed journal articles with an h-index of 43 and ~6900 citations (Scopus). He also holds 74 granted US patents, which have led to several commercialized products.</p>

  <p class="keynote-topic"><b>Topic of Keynote:</b> Design of Polymer Semiconductors with Readily Controlled Molecular and Nanoscale Structures for high performance printed organic electronics</p>
