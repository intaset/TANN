  <p class="body">Prof. Harri Lipsanen received his PhD from Helsinki University of Technology in 1994 and is currently a full professor in the Department of Electronics and Nanoengineering, Aalto University, Finland. Previously, he has served as Head of Optoelectronics Laboratory in Helsinki University of Technology and Head in the Department of Micro and Nanosciences in Aalto University. Currently Prof. Lipsanen studies nanomaterials and nanofabrication for various applications in photonics and nanoelectronics. His current research focus includes graphene and other 2D materials where he is a partner in EU’s large Graphene Flagship project. Another key topic is semiconductor nanowires based on III-V compound semiconductors and their heterostructures. His nanofabrication activities extend over many methods such as atomic layer deposition, metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy, electron beam lithography, self-assembly etc.  He has 30 years of experience in these topics and more generally in materials science.  Prof. Lipsanen has published about 300 peer-reviewed articles including 3 in the Nature Communications in 2016-17. He has close to 5000 citations to his papers (Google Scholar). Prof. Lipsanen is or has recently been in the Editorial Boards of Nano Energy Systems, Scientific Reports and Applied Sciences. In 2018, he is Nokia Visiting Professor and Visiting Professor in the University of Arizona.</p>
