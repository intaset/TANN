  <p class="body">Goldie Nejat, PhD, P.Eng. is the Canada Research Chair in Robots for Society and the Director of the Institute for Robotics and Mechatronics (IRM) at the University of Toronto. She is an Associate Professor in the Department of Mechanical & Industrial Engineering and the Founder and Director of the Autonomous Systems and Biomechatronics Laboratory (asblab.mie.utoronto.ca).  She is also an Adjunct Scientist at the Toronto Rehabilitation Institute.</p>
  <p class="body">Prof. Nejatâ€™s research focuses on developing intelligent service robots for applications in health, elderly care, emergency response, search and rescue, security and surveillance, and manufacturing. Her research is leading the development of intelligent assistive robotic aids that can meet the challenges posed by an aging population. Prof. Nejat has over 110 international publications in both the natural and health sciences domains. She has been invited to speak about her research to researchers, scientists, and healthcare professionals at many events and institutions around the world. She has served on the organizing and program committees of over twenty international conferences on robotics, automation, human-robot interaction and medical devices. Prof. Nejat is also an Associate Editor for IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters. Her team's work has been focused in numerous media outlets including Time magazine, The Naked Scientists, Reader's Digest, the National on CBC, Zoomer magazine, and the Discovery Channel. In 2013, she received the Engineers Canada Young Engineer Achievement Award and in 2012, she received the Professional Engineers of Ontario Young Engineer Medal.</p>
