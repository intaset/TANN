  <p class="body">Dr. Ricardo Izquierdo is a Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering at the Ecole de Technologie Superieure (ETS) in Montreal since June 2016 after 11 years as a professor in the microelectronics engineering program of the Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM). Previously to occupy those academic positions, he worked for seven years in the industry as Director of R&D at Technologies Novimage and OLA Display Corporation, where he contributed to the emergence of a cluster of research activities in the field of organic electronics in the Montreal area. At UQAM, he participated in the creation of two institutional research centers, one in nanomaterials and energy (NanoQAM), where he was adjunct director from its creation in 2007 until 2010, and the research center in Co-design and fabrication of microsystems (CoFaMic), which he has been directing from its creation in 2010 until now. He has large experience in photonic and electronic applications of nanomaterials, organic semiconductors, deposition and characterization of electroactive materials as well as in micro- and nano-fabrication technologies and the development of micro-devices (MEMS, OLEDs, sensors, solar cells, etc.).</p>

  <p class="keynote-topic"><b>Topic of Keynote:</b> Combination of Nanomaterials and Organic Semiconductors for Electronic and Pptoelectronic Device Fabrication</p>
